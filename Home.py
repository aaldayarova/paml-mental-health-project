st.markdown("### Project Overview")
st.markdown("""
This project aims to address the significant challenge of early mental health diagnosis. 
Depression and other mental health conditions affect 1 in 5 adults in the U.S., yet early 
diagnosis is often delayed due to stigma and difficulty recognizing early symptoms.

Our tool uses machine learning algorithms to predict mental health risk based on 
user-reported lifestyle and behavioral data. It provides personalized recommendations 
to support proactive mental health care.
